# MDI Search

MDI Search is a lightning fast search engine powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) to help developpers find the best [MDI icons](https://materialdesignicons.com) and building UIs.

Finding icons is a pain. Developpers need to quickly find relevant icons for a given context and don't want to scroll through thousands of icons and searching for an exact icon name. For a "success" page, they want an icon expressing success like the `check` icon. Searching for "success", **should** returns "check" icons, and it should be typo tolerant too.

MDI Search is self learning thanks to Algolia. The more users are using MDI Search, the more it displays relevant icons based one queries and matches made by others users.
